# üé• Movie Recommendation System with ChatGPT and MovieDB API

## Overview
This project is an intelligent **Movie Recommendation System** that leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT and the MovieDB API to provide users with tailored movie recommendations. By analyzing user preferences via natural language input, the system fetches relevant movie details from MovieDB and suggests films that match the user‚Äôs mood and genre preferences.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Users can input queries like ‚ÄúI want to watch a sci-fi thriller‚Äù or ‚ÄúGive me a romantic comedy.‚Äù
- **Real-time Movie Suggestions**: The system fetches movie data from MovieDB based on user input and filters results according to genres, ratings, and popularity.
- **Detailed Movie Information**: Users can view movie descriptions, release dates, trailers, and ratings.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Recommendations adjust based on user feedback and changing preferences.

## Functionality

### User Input
- Users interact with the recommendation engine through a web interface, entering natural language queries.
- Example queries include:
  - "Show me popular action movies."
  - "I'm in the mood for a comedy."

### Recommendation Process
- **Step 1**: The input is processed by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT API, which analyzes the text and extracts key information such as movie genres, preferred tones, or specific actors.
- **Step 2**: Based on the processed input, the system sends a request to the MovieDB API, searching for movies that match the query criteria (e.g., genre, popularity, release date).
- **Step 3**: The results are returned as a list of movie recommendations, displayed on the frontend with additional movie details (plot, trailers, ratings).

### User Experience
- **Home Page**: Users are greeted with a search box where they can enter their movie preferences.
- **Recommendation Page**: The system presents the recommended movies with clickable options to explore trailers, plot details, and ratings.
